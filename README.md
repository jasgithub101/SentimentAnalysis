# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on **1.6 million tweets** using multiple Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning models. The goal is to classify tweets as **positive, negative** by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** for text preprocessing and feature extraction. The final model achieved **94.8% accuracy**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Lemmatization, acronym expansion, contraction expansion, stopword removal, lower casing, removing usernames, tokenization
- **Sentiment Classification**: ML and DL models trained and evaluated for high accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Tensorflow
- **Models**: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, CNN 
- **NLP Techniques**: Bag of words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec


## 📊 Results
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC curve
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows correct vs incorrect predictions

## 🤖 Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning deep learning models (BERT, LSTM)
- Expanding dataset for better generalization
- Deploying as an API for real-time sentiment analysis
